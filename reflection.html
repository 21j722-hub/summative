                <p>[One thing I struggled with most during coding was using flex. At first, I used flex for the header of my first page. However, as there are more and more subpages, I struggle to use flex in an external style sheet. When something in my code didn’t work, I usually inspected the elements on the page to see what was wrong. Then, I changed the bug officially in VS Code. Alternatively, I can ask Tr. Howard for help. 
                    Wireframing is way easier because there is less thinking required, and the code is done by the website instead of me. There is also less knowledge that we have to learn to make a wireframe.
                    One thing I learned about myself while learning to code is that I’m not good at learning on my own. For example, I learned about flex on my own in this unit, and that is something I still struggle with to this day.</p>
